    In this document, we will use $\bot$ for \textmd{false} and $\top$ for \textmd{true} to indicate the answer to true-false questions.
\end{quote}

\section{Exercise 1}
\subsection{Question 1}
\tocless\subsubsection{Question a.}
$\bot$: The word \textsl{action} is not a verb in english since it never appears with the suffix \textsl{ing} or in the construction \textsl{to + verb}. It is a noun, as it can be preceeded by a determiner such as \textsl{the} or \textsl{a}, complemented by an adjective as in \textsl{the final action} or be the object of a verb group: \textsl{to realize an action}.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question b.}
$\bot$: The word \textsl{modifier} is not an adjective in english since it cannot be added to a noun group, e.g. \textsl{the modifier house} or \textsl{a modifier color}. This word is a noun : \textsl{I added a modifier to this colour}. There might be ambiguity in the sentence \textsl{I added a colour modifier}, but here \textsl{colour} acts as a complement to the noun \textsl{modifier}.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question c.}
$\top$: The word \textsl{couper} is a verb as it bears the suffix \textsl{er} and can be conjugated, such as in \textsl{Je coupe, Tu coupes, Il coupe, Nous coupons, Vous coupez, Ils coupent}, it can bear the mark of a tense : \textsl{couperai} or \textsl{coupâmes}. 

\tocless\subsubsection{Question d.}
$\top$: The word \textsl{chaque} is a determiner since it can preceed any noun group, e.g. \textsl{chaque fille} or \textsl{chaque décomposition en facteurs premiers}. 

\section{Exercise 2}
\subsection{Question 1}
\tocless\subsubsection{Question a.}
$\bot$: No, the specified order in ($\alpha$) is not observed, since $B$ should come before $C$.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question b.}
$\bot$: No, the specified order in ($\delta$) is not observed, since $z$ should come before $w$.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question c.}
$\bot$: No, there is no rule of the form $A \rightarrow C$, and, even then, the specified order in ($\delta$) is not observed, since $z$ should come before $w$.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question d.}
$\top$: From ($\alpha$), the structure $A \rightarrow B$ exists, and from ($\beta$), the structure $A \rightarrow x$ exists.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question e.}
$\bot$: There is no rule allowing $B$ to have two \og children \fg in the tree, i.e. no rule of the form $B \rightarrow \aleph\ \beth$ or $B \rightarrow \aleph\ (\beth)$. Both ($\beta$) and ($\gamma$) cannot apply here since they plan for $B$ to have a unique child, either $x$ or $y$.

\tocless\subsubsection{Question f.}
$\bot$: There is no rule allowing for $C$ to have a unique children $w$. The specified order in ($\delta$) is not observed since there is no $z$ to come before $w$.

\subsection{Question 2}

\tocless\subsubsection{Question d.}
