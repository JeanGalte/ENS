    \section{Question 1}
    In datasets $4 - 5 - 6$, the modified sentences are built on the model of datasets $1 - 2 - 3$.\\
    However, they are not natural sentences. Indeed, sentence $4.d)$ would more naturally be said as \textsl{Who did the person Mary met like ?}.\\
    Yet, it would be natural to extract from datasets $1$ to $3$ this rule for building questions, and those datasets are made of common sentences, while interrogative sentences in datasets $4$ to $6$ are far less common (in French and English) as they would use passive modality.\\
    Thus, this shows the difficulty for a child to extrapolate the rules for building questions (and thus learning language) from their environment.

    \section{Question 2}
        From sentences $a$ and $b$ we get that morphemes \textsl{kin} means \textsl{I} and \textsl{ku} means \textsl{he}, since those morphemes are the only that differ. Similarly, we get from sentences $d$ and $e$ that \textsl{ka} means \textsl{you}.\\
        Adding to that sentences $c$ and $g$, we find that those morphemes also indicate the present tense, and that \textsl{shu} means \textsl{he} in a past tense. We extrapolate that \textsl{shin} and \textsl{sha} thus mean \textsl{I} and \textsl{you} in a past tense. \\
        From sentences, $c, d, e$, we get that \textsl{wetam´axlek´em} means \textsl{learning the (art of) weaving} and so that \textsl{katax´ın} means \textsl{continually}.\\
        Given sentences $f$ and $g$, we can get that \textsl{wetam´ax} means \textsl{to learn} and \textsl{lek´em} means \textsl{(the art of) weaving}.\\
        From sentences $a$ and $b$ we identify the morpheme \textsl{sik´ıxlel´ıbr} to mean \textsl{to study the book}, and, adding sentence $h$ we get \textsl{w´ır} means \textsl{yesterday}.\\
        Based on our knowledge of other languages, we might want to hypothetise that in \textsl{sik´ıxlel´ıbr}, \textsl{sik´ıx} means \textsl{study}, \textsl{le} means \textsl{the} and \textsl{l´ıbr} means \textsl{book}, but there is no evidence of that in the dataset.
